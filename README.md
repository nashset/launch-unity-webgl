# launch-unity-webgl

Allows you to launch Unity WebGL builds without having to "Build and Run" it.
Every.
Single.
Time.
Just place the batch file in the same directory as your WebGL build's "index.html", run it,
and it should automatically open in your default web-browser.

*REQUIRES PYTHON INSTALLATION.

*Includes a bash version for Linux users.

*The line of code allowing you to access the build from another computer technically works,
then stalls completely.
Just use itch.io at that point.

*Perhaps one shouldn't use Unity at all.
